# LetsGrabCoffee
This should be pretty easy to build
LetsGrabCoffee - when you're in a new city, finds people you'd be interested in getting coffee with
Basically you have a user system that takes the userâ€™s location, job and any other fields
And then maybe the main app is just a city selector that once you select will spit out contact info of someone it thinks you would enjoy having coffee with
Look into devise for the user system, it makes it pretty easy

Use rspec to test the entire thing as well
